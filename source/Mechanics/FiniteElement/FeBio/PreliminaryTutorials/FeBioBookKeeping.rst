This tutorial outlines a way to manage the data that composes a finite element model. This is important because data management is the foundation of a model development workflow. A scripted model development workflow is useful for ensuring that consistent methods are used to develop finite element models for multiple subjects/specimens.

This tutorial focuses on how to manage the model's geometry and the corresponding nodesets and elementsets.

Construction of this tutorial is in progress
